# ci-server

This project is my local implementation of a CI environment. Its main purposes are to practice infra-as-code and create a well documented reference repository. Milestones are defined [here](MILESTONES.md).

## Workflow

1. [create base image](image/README.md)
2. [update base jenkins config](jenkins/README.md)
